# Hard Difficulty Level Ideas

## 1)Create API endpoints

Using the Django Rest API framework, build out API endpoints.

This should be used to serve as the backend for an app built using react native/ flutter so that users can access the services through mobile too.
## 2)Request forum
Create a request forum where users can request for a particular resource that they are looking for and other users can upload the same.
## 3)Youtube type resource
In this a new type of resource must be created where users can upload helpful YouTube video links, that should play within an embedded player in the website.
## 4)Make iiitbONE as CollegeONE!
Create a page which allows any college to open their own version of ONE. When a college creates their ONE, the administration should be given a admin panel to control all resources in their ONE. ONE should be separated for different colleges so that all colleges can implement and enjoy this platform.
